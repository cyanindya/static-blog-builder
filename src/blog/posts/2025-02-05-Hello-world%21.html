<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>
	We all know how new projects should always be started by a "hello world" post, so I decided
	to make one as well.
</p>
<p>
	This file serves to give you an example on how you should write your post before compiling the file
	into browser-readable HTML file.
</p>

<p>
	As you see by now, the contents of your blog post should be written in HTML. The HTML file should be saved
	with name format denoting the post date and post title, although this is not mandatory. If you notice the first
	comment of this document, you see the full title of this post; the <code>make-blog.js</code> will use that comment
	as the post title, and if no date is given in the file name, the program will use current date.
</p>
<p>
	If you want to create multi-page blog post, simply add <code>&lt;!-- break --gt;</code> between two paragraphs.
	You should see the output file under <code>dist/blog/posts/</code> already have the post paged.
</p>
<p>
	By default, I use the <a href="https://github.com/czue/bluesky-comments">bluesky-comments</a> library to use
	existing Bluesky thread from my account as comment section of the post. If you'd like to use other services such as
	Disqus, you'll need to make adjustments to the <code>template-blog-main.hbs</code> file.
</p>

<p>
	I think that concludes my brief write-up on how to use the static blog generator.
</p>
<p>
	Have fun!
